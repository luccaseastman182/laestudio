# Development Guide

## Overview
This development guide provides instructions and best practices for contributing to the laestudio project. It covers the development environment setup, coding standards, and guidelines for creating new components and features.

## Development Environment Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/luccaseastman182/laestudio.git
   cd laestudio
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to start developing.

## Coding Standards
- Use TypeScript for all new components and features.
- Follow the existing code style and conventions.
- Write clear and concise comments for complex logic.
- Ensure all code passes linting and formatting checks.

## Creating New Components
1. Create a new file in the `src/components` directory with a descriptive name.
2. Define the component using TypeScript and React.
3. Add TypeScript types for props and state.
4. Implement the component's functionality and UI.
5. Write unit tests for the component in the `src/tests` directory.
6. Update the relevant documentation if necessary.

## Adding TypeScript Types
- Use TypeScript's type system to define props, state, and other data structures.
- Prefer using `interface` over `type` for defining object shapes.
- Use `enum` for defining a set of named constants.
- Ensure all functions have explicit return types.

## Development Steps
1. Plan the feature or component you want to develop.
2. Create a new branch for your work.
3. Implement the feature or component following the coding standards.
4. Write tests to ensure the functionality works as expected.
5. Commit your changes with a clear and descriptive message.
6. Push your branch to the repository and open a pull request.

## Best Practices
- Keep components small and focused on a single responsibility.
- Use functional components and React hooks.
- Avoid using any in TypeScript; prefer specific types.
- Reuse existing components and utilities where possible.
- Write meaningful commit messages and pull request descriptions.

## Testing
- Write unit tests for all new components and features.
- Use integration tests to verify the interaction between components.
- Perform manual testing to ensure the application works as expected.
- Run performance tests to identify and fix any bottlenecks.

## Documentation
- Update the relevant documentation for any new features or changes.
- Ensure the documentation is clear, concise, and easy to understand.
- Use code examples to illustrate complex concepts.

## Deployment
- Follow the deployment guide for deploying the application to production.
- Ensure all tests pass before deploying.
- Monitor the application for any issues after deployment.

## Conclusion
By following this development guide, you can contribute effectively to the laestudio project and help maintain a high-quality codebase. If you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to reach out to the project maintainers.
